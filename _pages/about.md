I am a Traditional Master's/PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Prof. [Yong Jae Lee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yongjaelee/). In the past, I have been fortunate to receive the mentorship of Dr. [Utkarsh Ojha](https://utkarshojha.github.io), Dr.[Yuheng Li](https://yuheng-li.github.io) and Dr. [Haotian Liu](https://hliu.cc). I am extremely interested in problems pertaining to Deep Learning and its intersections with computer vision.

Recently, I have worked on Fake Image Detection, focusing on latent diffusion models to improve detection robustness and generalization. Previously, I have explored image editing with latent diffusion models and distillation of discriminative networks. Across my projects, I aim to approach problems in a principled manner, balancing theoretical insights with practical impact.
